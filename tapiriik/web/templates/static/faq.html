	<h3>{% trans "What do I have to do to use Hub by DECATHLON?" %}</h3>
	{% trans "Just connect to all the services you would like to sync between, click &quot;Synchronize now,&quot; then forget ever reading this sentence." %}

<div>
	<h3>{% trans "Which activities get synchronized?" %}</h3>

	<h3>{% trans "What about activities I've marked as private?" %}</h3>
	{% trans "By default, <b>Hub by DECATHLON will <u>not</u> sync private activities</b>.

</div>

<div class="right">
	<h3>{% trans "The activity statistics changed after a sync!" %}</h3>
	{% trans "Discrepancies in activity statistics, like elevation gained/lost or calories burned, appear when <strong>services use different algorithms to calculate the same values</strong>. <strong>Hub by DECATHLON does not calculate these</strong> during synchronization." %}
